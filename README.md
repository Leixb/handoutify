# Handoutify

A library and utilities to remove the pause from beamer presentations,
effectively making them ["handouts"][0].

The utilities are currently just a web app. An instance is available on
https://tools.nilsand.re/handoutify/

It would be nice to have a cli to supplement that but this hasn't been
implemented yet.
